# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Enforcement Guidelines
Project leadership will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning for minor infractions, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
4. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers via our [Community Code of Conduct Report Form](https://forms.gle/i5s6y9i145vsT8a49). 

You may submit reports completely anonymously. However, if you wish to be updated on the progress of your report or are willing to provide more details, please leave an optional contact method (Email or GitHub ID) in the form. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and we will maintain strict confidentiality. We aim to respond
